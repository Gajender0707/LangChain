Handling missing values and performing EDA are crucial steps in data preprocessing. Missing values can distort analysis and model performance, so they are either removed or imputed using strategies like mean, median, or mode. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps in understanding data patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables. It involves summarizing data using statistics like mean and standard deviation, and visualizing it through histograms, boxplots, count plots, and heatmaps. EDA also helps detect outliers and correlations. Together, handling missing data and EDA ensure that the dataset is clean, reliable, and ready for further modeling or machine learning tasks.
